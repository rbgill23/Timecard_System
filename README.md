# Timecard_System (Still in progress ~60% complete)
Program to keep track of employee time at work. Built for a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and includes a MariaDB server. The inital reasoning for working on this project was to help keep better records and to further my own learning in object oriented programming and GUI development.

Utilizes Python 3 and MariaDB.
Imports the tkinter and datetime modules.  
Tkinter is being used for the GUI development.   
PAGE (http://page.sourceforge.net/) was used to help visually set all the buttons, entrys, etc., which is the reason why each button or label has a large configuration section.  
Some of the program will not work do to no connection to the database.
